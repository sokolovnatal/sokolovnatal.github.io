	<h1>Hi! Welcome to my site :D</h1>
	<p>
        Hi! My name is Nat! I'm a queer electrical engineering student. I think I'm pretty boring,
        but I'm working on becoming an interesting person.
        <br>
        I started making this website August 7, 2023. I'm interested in the revival of the old web
        and miss the nostalgic early 2000s websites. I think the internet should be a place where you
        can explore and get lost in everyone's interesting websites. I think people shouldn't be
        afraid of showing their interests on the internet and should be free to express themselves!
        Cringe is dead!
    </p>

	<h2>Things to expect:</h2>
	<p>
        I have a love for robotics, rocketry, space, dungeons and dragons, 
        cool shows, and cool games. I'll be blogging about my projects and attempts at art,
        as well as comments about any media I consume. Feel free to explore and see what I
        have to say! (Some links might not work as this is a WIP)
